### Description of Blog Site:
Users must register and log in to use the blog site to publish articles, journals, and class notes. Logged in users have access to view other people's written blogs, and have the choice to create their own as well. Created blogs have the option to be edited even after publishing. Each user has a profile page that displays their name and username. Each page beside editing a blog has a button to go back to home page, and to log out. EVERYTHING IS PUBLIC!!! DON'T PUT THINGS ON BLOGS YOU DON'T WANT OTHERS TO SEE!!!
