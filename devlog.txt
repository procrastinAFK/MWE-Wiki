INITIAL DD REVIEW
	program components:
		- need a few more details in component explanations, too vague right now
		component map + explanation:
		+ well organized
		- need better explanation of interactions, when we need to use flask
	database organization:
		+ good examples used for clarity
		Q need to find out how we might implement creation date field in table
	page data:
		+ cool to have editor field in a page's data, good explanations for columns
		- what if multiple people edit the same part of the page? current table doesn't support crediting all
	user data:
		+ good idea to keep hashed passwords
	front end:
		+ nice webpage diagram, well-organized front end diagram
		Q what happens to "edited by: ____" when there is a really long list of editors?
	task delegation:
		- split a little more evenly
