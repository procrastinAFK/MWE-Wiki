INITIAL DD REVIEW
	program components:
		- need a few more details in component explanations, too vague right now
		component map + explanation:
		+ well organized
		- need better explanation of interactions, when we need to use flask
	database organization:
		+ good examples used for clarity
		Q need to find out how we might implement creation date field in table
	page data:
		+ cool to have editor field in a page's data, good explanations for columns
		- what if multiple people edit the same part of the page? current table doesn't support crediting all
	user data:
		+ good idea to keep hashed passwords
	front end:
		+ nice webpage diagram, well-organized front end diagram
		Q what happens to "edited by: ____" when there is a really long list of editors?
	task delegation:
		- split a little more evenly

FINAL TOUCHES
	Kinda forgot to do devlog for some stuff... but it all came together today and yesterday so here:
	Attempted to write code for view, edit, new. Got working code, but most of it was overwritten by Evan in the end
	Added headers to all files
	Fixed formatting so that most recent blogs come first, most recent entries come first
	Did some minor debugging in data.py
	Added details to readme
	Generally polished formatting for most pages, fixed many links to be working buttons
	Tested with 3/4 teammates!

FINAL TOUCHES
	Designed the front end and used CSS stylize parts.
	After certain merge conflicts, the CSS for buttons broke, and 3 people including myself was pushing to main.
	I decided to wait for the final code in order to minimize conflits.
	After waiting, the code broke even on a clean repository clone of the most updated code.
	Maya has been trying to trouble shoot while my eyes can't stay open.
	I am overall grateful for the chance to learn CSS while it happened.

LAST MIN DETAILS
	Design doc minor changes to accurately reflect what we did: 
		added some attributes to tables that weren't originally in the design doc but that we realized we needed
		added entry_id field
		removed helper.py since we didn't end up using it
		added "newblog" task to task delegation table
	Attempted to dig deeper into alarming issue of site not working on Ashley's computer. Git Bash decided it hates me and
	won't let me make a new clone of the repo/omits __init__.py when I do. Think it's just a problem on my computer,
	but I guess we'll find out.
